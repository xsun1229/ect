An R package for Effect Consistency Test

## Installation

You can install the development version of ect from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("xsun1229/ect")
```

Then load it

``` r
library(ect)
```

## Overview of the Functions

We provide two main functions in this package:

1.  [`prune_snps()`](reference/prune_snps.md) — Select independent SNPs

Selects independent SNPs using PLINK clumping and LD pruning.

2.  [`ECT()`](reference/ECT.md) — Effect Consistency Test

Performs an adaptive resampling test to assess whether SNP effect
directions on an outcome (GWAS trait) are consistent with those on an
exposure (pathway factor).
